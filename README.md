## Abstract
> The rapid growth of the global population has placed immense pressure on agriculture to enhance food production while addressing environmental and socioeconomic challenges such as biodiversity loss, water scarcity, and climate variability. Addressing these challenges requires adopting modern techniques and advancing agricultural research. Although some techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, are increasingly used in agriculture, progress is constrained by the lack of large labelled datasets. This constraint arises because collecting data is often time-consuming, labour-intensive, and requires expert knowledge for data annotation. To mitigate data limitations, transfer learning (TL) offers a viable solution by allowing pre-trained models to be adapted for agricultural applications. Many researchers have demonstrated TL's potential to advance agriculture. Despite its importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive review, which could be essential to guide researchers in this field. Given the significance and the lack of a review paper, this paper provides a review dedicated to TL in agriculture, offering three main contributions. First, we provide an in-depth background study on TL and its applications in agriculture. Second, we offer a comprehensive examination of TL-based agricultural applications, covering pre-trained models, dataset sources, input image types, implementation platforms, and TL approaches. Third, based on an exploration of the existing studies, we identify the challenges faced when applying TL in agriculture. Finally, to address the identified challenges, we recommend suggestions for future research directions
